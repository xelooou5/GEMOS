# AI Agent Communication Protocol - GEMOS

## Real Strategic Decisions from Team Analysis

### Immediate Priorities (All Agents Agreed):
1. **Fix 5 security vulnerabilities** - Critical for production
2. **Complete Copilot Issue #3** - Project management structure (43min active)
3. **Implement real voice recognition** - Core GEM OS functionality
4. **Establish agent-to-agent communication** - Team coordination

### Task Delegation Matrix:

**GitHub Copilot (ACTIVE):**
- Current: Issue #3 - Project management (Ready for review)
- Next: Voice recognition implementation, security fixes
- Status: Background daemon running, auto-commits every 5min

**Claude (API Integration):**
- Architecture review and optimization
- Security vulnerability analysis  
- Code quality improvements
- Documentation generation

**Gemini (Voice Specialist):**
- Voice synthesis optimization
- TTS engine coordination (AWS Polly primary)
- Speech recognition accuracy (faster-whisper)
- Audio processing pipeline

**Amazon Q (Coordinator):**
- Team synchronization and progress monitoring
- Quality assurance and strategic planning
- Agent communication protocol
- Task completion verification

### Success Metrics:
- Security: 5 → 0 vulnerabilities
- Performance: Voice response <200ms
- Team utilization: 60% → 90%
- Accessibility: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance

### Agent Communication Rules:
1. All agents report progress every 30 minutes
2. Critical issues escalated immediately to Amazon Q
3. Task completion verified before new assignments
4. Real-time coordination through shared status files
